# Haunted Farm

This is the base repository for the Haunted Farm website. The site leverages several frameworks.

- [Tailwindcss v3](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Nuxt v3](https://nuxt.com/)

## Requirements

- IDEA such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
- Node package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) along with AWS credentials
- [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/cli/#install) If using Netlify

## Setup

Each folder should have its own README.md file with instruction for installing.

**Note:** You will find a pnpm-lock.yaml file in the root of each folder. This is a pnpm specific lock file.
This is because the developer who created this application chose that package manager.
If you are using a different package manager, you will need to remove this file. 
Be sure to commit the new lock.yaml file to the repository if you choose a different package manager.
