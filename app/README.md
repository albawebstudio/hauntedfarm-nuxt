# Haunted Farm / Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Requirements

- Node package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) along with AWS credentials 
- [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/cli/#install) If using Netlify

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies (using your preferred package manager):

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

You have a few options for starting the development server. The suggestion is to use `netlify dev`,
but the standard `nuxt dev` is available.

```bash
# npm
npm run netlify-dev
-- or --
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run netlify-dev
-- or --
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn netlify-dev
-- or --
yarn run dev

# bun
bun run netlify-dev
-- or --
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
